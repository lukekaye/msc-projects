# Time Series Analysis & Forecasting of Monthly Product Sales

## Overview 

Within `projectdata.txt` are a series of numerical vectors intended to represent time series data of products over a
ten-year period, from January 2011 to December 2020 inclusive. One of these vectors was selected for analysis.

Within `code.R` is this analysis, exploring the selected time series and building various models for it. Forecasting is
then conducted for a 6 month period following the series, using a final selected model. ARIMA, time series regression
and dynamic linear models were all considered and contrasted. Forecasting accuracy was evaluated using a train & test
split of the data.

`report.pdf` is a coherent writeup, detailing the procedure followed for this analysis.

Furthermore, two mathematical problems, one relating to a seasonal ARIMA model, and one relating to time series
regression models with Fourier seasonal coefficients, are disjointly solved afterwards, in the report.
